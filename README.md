I am an **IT Specialist** focused on **System Administration** and **Cybersecurity**.

My work lies at the intersection of technical logic and human behavior. With a background interest in psychology, I approach technology not just as code, but as a system that interacts with people. I value **digital sovereignty**, **minimalism**, and **stability**.

I don't chase trends; I build resilient infrastructure that simply works.
