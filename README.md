I am a Fullstack Developer with a focus on System Administration and Cybersecurity.  
I build and maintain reliable, scalable systems that work under real-world conditions.  
My approach combines solid technical foundations with an understanding of human behavior, ensuring systems are secure, efficient, and maintainable.  

I value digital sovereignty, minimalism, and stability.  
I don’t follow trends—I deliver solutions that last.
